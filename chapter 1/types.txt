Type annotations and Type interface in typescript
1. Type annotations : code we add to tell the typescript what type of value a variable will refer to.
2. Type inference   : typescriptn tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.

'any' type in typescript
1. A type just as string, boolean are.
2. It means that typescript has no idea what this is - can't check.
3. Avoid variable with any at all cost.

       Type annotations            <--->          Type inference
    we decide the type of value              typescript guesses the type

    when to use it : -                       when to use it : -
when we declare a variable in                        Always
one line then initialize it later.

when we want a variable to have a
type that can't be inferred.

when the function returns any type 
and we need the clarify the value.
